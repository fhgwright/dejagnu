# This file requires a slightly modified dmucs, which has been modified
# to support mutiple architectures for toolchain testing. Dmucs sends
# the cpu load to a server, which we can query using the 'gethost' command
# to get the next available slave for a remote test based on which one is
# the less busy. The code for this enhanced dmuc is at:
# http://git.linaro.org/git/toolchain/dmucs.git
#
