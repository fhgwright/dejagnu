    <title>Running Tests</title>

    <para>There are two ways to execute a testsuite. The most
    common way is when there is existing support in the
    <filename>Makefile</filename> of the tool being tested. This
    usually consists of a
    <emphasis>check</emphasis> target. The other way is to execute the
    <command>runtest</command> program directly. To run
    <command>runtest</command> directly from the command line requires
    either all of the correct command line options, or a
    <xref linkend="local"/> must be set up correctly.</para>

    <sect2 id="makecheck" xreflabel="Make Check">
      <title>Running 'make check'</title>

      <para>To run tests from an existing collection, first use
      <command>configure</command> as usual to set up the build
      directory. Then type:</para>

      <screen>
      make check
      </screen>

      <para>If the <emphasis>check</emphasis> target exists, it
      usually saves you some trouble. For instance, it can set up any
      auxiliary programs or other files needed by the tests. The most
      common file the <emphasis>check</emphasis> target depends on is
      the
      <filename>site.exp</filename> file. The site.exp file contains
      various variables that &dj; used to determine the configuration
      of the program being tested. This is mostly for supporting
      remote testing.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>check</emphasis> target is supported by GNU
      <productname>Automake</productname>. To have &dj; support added to your
      generated <filename>Makefile.in</filename>, just add the keyword
      <command>dejagnu</command> to the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable in
      your <filename>Makefile.am</filename> file.</para>

      <para>Once you have run <emphasis>make check</emphasis> to build
      any auxiliary files, you can invoke the test driver
      <command>runtest</command> directly to repeat the tests.
      You will also have to execute <command>runtest</command>
      directly for test collections with no
      <emphasis>check</emphasis> target in the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

      <para>The <command>runtest</command>
      option <option>--debug</option> creates a file showing the
      output from
      <productname>Expect</productname> in debugging mode. The
      <filename>dbg.log</filename> file is created in the directory
      where you start <command>runtest</command>.  The log file shows
      the string sent to the tool under test by
      each <command>send</command> command and the pattern it compares
      with the tool output by each <command>expect</command>
      command.</para>

      <para>The log messages begin with a message of the form:

	<screen>
	expect: does {<symbol>tool output</symbol>} (spawn_id <symbol>n</symbol>)
 	   match pattern {<emphasis>expected pattern</emphasis>}?
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>For every unsuccessful match,
      <productname>Expect</productname> issues a
      <emphasis>no</emphasis> after this message. If other patterns
      are specified for the same <productname>Expect</productname>
      command, they are reflected also, but without the first part of
      the message (<emphasis>expect... match
      pattern</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>When <productname>Expect</productname> finds a match, the
      log for the successful match ends with <emphasis>yes</emphasis>,
      followed by a record of the <productname>Expect</productname>

	<para>This example exhibits three properties of
	<productname>Expect</productname> and
	<productname>&dj;</productname> that might be surprising at
	first glance:</para>

	<itemizedlist mark="bullet">
	<listitem><para>Empty output for the first attempted match.  The
	first set of attempted matches shown ran against the output
	<emphasis>{}</emphasis> --- that is, no
	output. <productname>Expect</productname> begins
	attempting to match the patterns supplied immediately; often,
	the first pass is against incomplete output (or completely
	before all output, as in this case).</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Interspersed tool output.  The beginning of
	the log entry for the second attempted match may be hard to
	spot: this is because the prompt <emphasis>{(gdb) }</emphasis>
	appears on the same line, just before the
	<emphasis>expect:</emphasis> that marks the beginning of the
	log entry.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Fail-safe patterns.  Many of the patterns
	tested are fail-safe patterns provided by
	<productname>GDB</productname> testing utilities, to reduce
	possible indeterminacy.  It is useful to anticipate potential
	variations caused by extreme system conditions
	(<productname>GDB</productname> might issue the message
	<emphasis>virtual memory exhausted</emphasis> in rare
	circumstances), or by changes in the tested program
	(<emphasis>Undefined command</emphasis> is the likeliest
	outcome if the name of a tested command changes).</para>

	<para>The pattern <emphasis>{return}</emphasis> is a
	particularly interesting fail-safe to notice; it checks for an
	unexpected <keycap>RET</keycap> prompt.  This may happen,
	for example, if the tested tool can filter output through a
	pager.</para>

	<para>These fail-safe patterns (like the debugging log itself)
	are primarily useful while developing test scripts.  Use the
	<command>error</command> procedure to make the actions for
	fail-safe patterns produce messages starting with
	<emphasis>ERROR</emphasis> on standard output, and in the
	detailed log file.</para></listitem>

  <sect1 id="Customizing" xreflabel="Customizing DejaGnu">
    <title>Customizing &dj;</title>

    <para>The site configuration file, <filename>site.exp</filename>,
    captures configuration-dependent values and propagates them to the
    &dj; test environment using Tcl variables.  This ties the
    &dj; test scripts into the <command>configure</command> and
    <command>make</command> programs. If this file is setup correctly,
    it is possible to execute a testsuite merely by typing
    <command>runtest</command>.</para>

    <para>&dj; supports two <filename>site.exp</filename>
    files. The multiple instances of <filename>site.exp</filename> are
    loaded in a fixed order built into &dj;. The first file loaded
    is the local file <filename>site.exp</filename>, and then the
    optional global <filename>site.exp</filename> file as
    pointed to by the <symbol>DEJAGNU</symbol> environment
    variable.</para>

    <para>There is an optional <emphasis>master</emphasis>
    <filename>site.exp</filename>, capturing configuration values that
    apply to &dj; across the board, in each configuration-specific
    subdirectory of the &dj; library directory.
    <command>runtest</command> loads these values first. The master
    <filename>site.exp</filename> contains the default values for all
    targets and hosts supported by &dj;. This master file is
    identified by setting the environment variable
    <symbol>DEJAGNU</symbol> to the name of the file. This is also
    referred to as the ``global'' config file.</para>

    <para>Any directory containing a configured testsuite also has a
    local <filename>site.exp</filename>, capturing configuration values
    specific to the tool under test.  Since <command>runtest</command>
    loads these values last, the individual test configuration can
    either rely on and use, or override, any of the global values from
    the global <filename>site.exp</filename> file.</para>

    <para>You can usually generate or update the testsuite's local
    <filename>site.exp</filename> by typing <command>make
    site.exp</command> in the testsuite directory, after the test
    suite is configured.</para>

    <para>You can also have a file in your home directory called
    <filename>.dejagnurc</filename>. This gets loaded first before the
    other config files. Usually this is used for personal stuff, like
    setting the <symbol>all_flag</symbol> so all the output gets
    printed, or your own verbosity levels. This file is usually
    restricted to setting command line options.</para>

    <para>You can further override the default values in a
    user-editable section of any <filename>site.exp</filename>, or by
    setting variables on the <command>runtest</command> command
    line.</para>

    <sect2 id="local" xreflabel="Local Config File">
      <title>Local Config File</title>

      <para>It is usually more convenient to keep these <emphasis>manual
      overrides</emphasis> in the <filename>site.exp</filename>
      local to each test directory, rather than in the global
      <filename>site.exp</filename> in the installed &dj;
      library. This file is mostly for supplying tool specific info
      that is required by the testsuite.</para>

      <para>All local <filename>site.exp</filename> files have
      two sections, separated by comment text. The first section is
      the part that is generated by <command>make</command>. It is
      essentially a collection of Tcl variable definitions based on
      <filename>Makefile</filename> environment variables. Since they
      are generated by <command>make</command>, they contain the
      values as specified by <command>configure</command>.  (You can
      also customize these values by using the <option>--site</option>
      option to <command>configure</command>.) In particular, this
      section contains the <filename>Makefile</filename>
      variables for host and target configuration data. Do not edit
      this first section; if you do, your changes are replaced next
      time you run <command>make</command>.</para>

      <example>
        <title>The first section starts with</title>

	<programlisting>
	## these variables are automatically generated by make ##
	# Do not edit here. If you wish to override these values
	# add them to the last section
	</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>In the second section, you can override any default values
      (locally to &dj;) for all the variables.  The second section
      can also contain your preferred defaults for all the command
      line options to <command>runtest</command>. This allows you to
      easily customize <command>runtest</command> for your preferences
      in each configured test-suite tree, so that you need not type
      options repeatedly on the command line.  (The second section may
      also be empty, if you do not wish to override any defaults.)</para>

      <example>
        <title>The first section ends with this line</title>

	<programlisting>
	## All variables above are generated by configure. Do Not Edit ##
	</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>You can make any changes under this line. If you wish to
      redefine a variable in the top section, then just put a
      duplicate value in this second section. Usually the values
      defined in this config file are related to the configuration of
      the test run. This is the ideal place to set the variables
      <symbol>host_triplet</symbol>, <symbol>build_triplet</symbol>,
      <symbol>target_triplet</symbol>. All other variables are tool
      dependent, i.e., for testing a compiler, the value for
      <symbol>CC</symbol> might be set to a freshly built binary, as
      opposed to one in the user's path.</para>

      <para>Here's an example local site.exp file, as used for
      <productname>GCC/G++</productname> testing.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Local Config File</title>

      <programlisting>

      set target_triplet i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1
      set target_alias i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1
      set CFLAGS ""
      set CXXFLAGS "-isystem /build/devo-builds/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/gcc/../libio -isystem $srcdir/../libg++/src -isystem $srcdir/../libio -isystem $srcdir/../libstdc++ -isystem $srcdir/../libstdc++/stl -L/build/devo-builds/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/gcc/../libg++ -L/build/devo-builds/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/gcc/../libstdc++"
      append LDFLAGS " -L/build/devo-builds/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/gcc/../ld"
      set tmpdir /build/devo-builds/i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1/gcc/testsuite

      ## All variables above are generated by configure. Do Not Edit ##

      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This file defines the required fields for a local config
    file, namely the three config triplets, and the srcdir. It also
    defines several other Tcl variables that are used exclusively by
    the GCC testsuite. For most test cases, the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    are supplied by &dj; itself for cross testing, but to test a
    compiler, GCC needs to manipulate these itself.</para>

    <para>The local <filename>site.exp</filename> may also set Tcl
    variables such as <symbol>test_timeout</symbol> which can control
    the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a remote test to
    complete. If not specified, <symbol>test_timeout</symbol> defaults
    to 300 seconds.</para>

     <sect2 id="global" xreflabel="Global Config File">
      <title>Global Config File</title>

      <para>The master config file is where all the target specific
      config variables for a whole site get set. The idea is
      that for a centralized testing lab where people have to share a
      target between multiple developers. There are settings for both
      remote targets and remote hosts.  Here's an example of a Master
      Config File (also called the Global config file) for a
      <emphasis>Canadian cross</emphasis>. A Canadian cross is when
      you build and test a cross compiler on a machine other than the
      one it's to be hosted on.</para>

      <para>Here we have the config settings for our California
      office. Note that all config values are site dependent. Here we
      have two sets of values that we use for testing m68k-aout cross
      compilers. As both of these target boards has a different
      debugging protocol, we test on both of them in sequence.</para>

      <example>
       <title>Global Config file</title>

      <programlisting>

      # Make sure we look in the right place for the board description files.
      if ![info exists boards_dir] {
          set boards_dir {}
      }
      lappend boards_dir "/nfs/cygint/s1/cygnus/dejagnu/boards"

      verbose "Global Config File: target_triplet is $target_triplet" 2
      global target_list

      case "$target_triplet" in {
          { "native" } {
              set target_list "unix"
          }
          { "sparc64-*elf" } {
              set target_list "sparc64-sim"
          }
          { "mips-*elf" } {
              set target_list "mips-sim wilma barney"
          }
          { "mips-lsi-elf" } {
              set target_list "mips-lsi-sim{,soft-float,el}"
          }
          { "sh-*hms" } {
              set target_list { "sh-hms-sim" "bloozy" }
          }
      }
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>In this case, we have support for several cross compilers,
    that all run on this host. For testing on operating systems that
    don't support Expect, &dj; can be run on the local build
    machine, and it can connect to the remote host and run all the
    tests for this cross compiler on that host. All the remote OS
    requires is a working Telnet server.</para>

    <para>As you can see, all one does is set the variable
    <symbol>target_list</symbol> to the list of targets and options to
    test. The simple settings, like for
    <emphasis>sparc64-elf</emphasis> only require setting the name of
    the single board config file. The <emphasis>mips-elf</emphasis>
    target is more complicated. Here it sets the list to three target
    boards. One is the default mips target, and both
    <emphasis>wilma</emphasis> <emphasis>barney</emphasis> are
    symbolic names for other mips boards. Symbolic names are covered
    in the <xref linkend="addboard"/> chapter. The more complicated
    example is the one for <emphasis>mips-lsi-elf</emphasis>. This one
    runs the tests with multiple iterations using all possible
    combinations of the <option>--soft-float</option> and the
    <option>--el</option> (little endian) option. Needless to say,
    this last feature is mostly compiler specific.</para>

    <sect2 id="boardconfig" xreflabel="Board Config File">
      <title>Board Configuration File</title>

      <para>The board config file is where board specific config data
      is stored. A board config file contains all the higher-level
      configuration settings. There is a rough inheritance scheme, where it is
      possible to base a new board description file on an existing one. There
      are also collections of custom procedures for common environments. For
      more information on adding a new board config file, go to the <xref
      linkend="addboard"/> chapter. </para>

      <para>An example board config file for a GNU simulator is as
      follows. <function>set_board_info</function> is a procedure that sets the
      field name to the specified value. The procedures in square brackets
      <emphasis>[]</emphasis> are <emphasis>helper procedures</emphasis>. These
      are used to find parts of a tool chain required to build an executable
      image that may reside in various locations. This is mostly of use for
      when the startup code, the standard C libraries, or the tool chain itself
      is part of your build tree.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Board Configuration File</title>

      # Used by a few gcc.c-torture testcases to delimit how large the
      # stack can be.
      set_board_info gcc,stack_size 16384
      # The simulator doesn't return exit statuses and we need to indicate this
      # the standard GCC wrapper will work with this target.

     </example>

     <para>There are five helper procedures used in this example. The first
     one, <function>find gcc</function> looks for a copy of the GNU compiler in
     your build tree, or it uses the one in your path. This will also return
     the proper transformed name for a cross compiler if you whole build tree
     is configured for one. The next helper procedures are
     <function>libgloss_include_flags</function> &amp;
     <function>libgloss_link_flags</function>. These return the proper flags to
     compiler and link an executable image using <xref
     linkend="libgloss"/>, the GNU BSP (Board Support Package). The final
     procedures are <function>newlib_include_flag</function> &amp;
     <function>newlib_include_flag</function>. These find the Newlib C
     library, which is a reentrant standard C library for embedded systems
     comprising of non GPL'd code.</para>

      FTP server so that it does not allow anonymous FTP. Set the home
      directory to the root directory (i.e. c:\) of a suitable
      drive. Allow writing via FTP.</para>

      <para>It will create an account like IUSR_FOOBAR where foobar is
      the name of your machine. Go into the user editor and give that
      account a password that you don't mind hanging around in the
      clear (i.e. not the same as your admin or personal
      passwords). Also, add it to all the various permission groups.</para>

      <para>You'll also need a telnet server. For Windows, go
      to the <ulink url="http://ataman.com">Ataman</ulink> web site,
      pick up the Ataman Remote Logon Services for Windows, and
      install it. You can get started on the eval period anyway. Add
      IUSR_FOOBAR to the list of allowed users, set the HOME directory
      to be the same as the FTP default directory. Change the Mode
      prompt to simple.</para>

      <para>Ok, now you need to pick a directory name to do all the
      testing in. For the sake of this example, we'll call it piggy
      (i.e. c:\piggy). Create this directory.</para>

      <para>You'll need a unix machine. Create a directory for the
      scripts you'll need. For this example, we'll use
      /usr/local/swamp/testing. You'll need to have a source tree
      somewhere, say /usr/src/devo. Now, copy some files from
      releng's area in SV to your machine:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Remote host setup</title>

      <screen>
      cd /usr/local/swamp/testing
      mkdir boards
      scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/cst/bin/MkTestDir .
      scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/site.exp .
      scp darkstar.welcomehome.org:/dejagnu/boards/useless98r2.exp boards/foobar.exp
      export DEJAGNU=/usr/local/swamp/testing/site.exp

      </screen>
      </example>

      <para>You must edit the boards/foobar.exp file to reflect your
      machine; change the hostname (foobar.com), username
      (iusr_foobar), password, and ftp_directory (c:/piggy) to match
      what you selected.</para>

      <para>Edit the global <filename> site.exp</filename> to reflect your
      boards directory:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Add The Board Directory</title>

	<programlisting>
	lappend boards_dir "/usr/local/swamp/testing/boards"
	</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Now run MkTestDir, which is in the contrib
	directory. The first parameter is the toolchain prefix, the
	second is the location of your devo tree. If you are testing a
	cross compiler (ex: you have sh-hms-gcc.exe in your PATH on
	the PC), do something like this:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Setup Cross Remote Testing</title>

	<programlisting>
	./MkTestDir sh-hms /usr/dejagnu/src/devo
	</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>If you are testing a native PC compiler (ex: you have
	gcc.exe in your PATH on the PC), do this:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Setup Native Remote Testing</title>

	<programlisting>
	./MkTestDir '' /usr/dejagnu/src/devo
	</programlisting>
      </example>

	<para>To test the setup, <command>ftp</command> to your PC
	using the username (iusr_foobar) and password you selected. CD
	to the test directory. Upload a file to the PC. Now telnet to
	your PC using the same username and password. CD to the test
	directory. Make sure the file is there. Type "set" and/or "gcc
	-v" (or sh-hms-gcc -v) and make sure the default PATH contains
	the installation you want to test.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Run Test Remotely</title>

	<programlisting>
	cd /usr/local/swamp/testing
	make  -k -w check RUNTESTFLAGS="--host_board foobar --target_board foobar -v -v" > check.out 2>&amp;1
	</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>To run a specific test, use a command like this (for
	this example, you'd run this from the gcc directory that
	MkTestDir created):</para>

      <example>
        <title>Run a Test Remotely</title>

	<programlisting>
	make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--host_board sloth --target_board sloth -v compile.exp=921202-1.c"
	</programlisting>
      </example>

	<para>Note: if you are testing a cross-compiler, put in the
	correct target board. You'll also have to download more .exp
	files and modify them for your local configuration. The -v's
	are optional.</para>

      <title>Adding a new tool</title>

      <para>In general, the best way to learn how to write code, or
      even prose, is to read something similar.  This principle
      applies to test cases and to testsuites.  Unfortunately,
      well-established testsuites have a way of developing their own
      conventions: as test writers become more experienced with &dj;
      and with Tcl, they accumulate more utilities, and take advantage
      of more and more features of
      <productname>Expect</productname>
      and <productname>Tcl</productname> in general.  Inspecting such
      established testsuites may make the prospect of creating an
      entirely new testsuite appear overwhelming.  Nevertheless, it is
      straightforward to start a new testsuite.</para>

      <para>To help orient you further in this task, here is an outline of the
      steps to begin building a testsuite for a program example.</para>

     <itemizedlist mark="bullet">

      <listitem><para>Create or select a directory to contain your new
      collection of tests. Change into that directory (shown here as
      <filename>testsuite</filename>):</para>

      <para>Create a <filename>configure.in</filename> file in this directory,
      to control configuration-dependent choices for your tests.  So far as
      &dj; is concerned, the important thing is to set a value for the
      variable <symbol>target_abbrev</symbol>; this value is the link to the
      init file you will write soon.  (For simplicity, we assume the
      environment is Unix, and use <emphasis>unix</emphasis> as the
      value.)</para>

      <para>What else is needed in <filename>configure.in</filename> depends on
      the requirements of your tool, your intended test environments, and which
      configure system you use.  This example is a minimal configure.in for use
      with <productname>GNU Autoconf</productname>. </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Create <filename>Makefile.in</filename> (if using
      Autoconf), or <filename>Makefile.am</filename> (if using
      Automake), the source file used by configure to build your
      <filename>Makefile</filename>. If you are using GNU Automake.just add the
      keyword <emphasis>dejagnu</emphasis> to the
      <emphasis>AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS</emphasis> variable in your
      <filename>Makefile.am</filename> file. This will add all
      the <filename>Makefile</filename> support needed to run &dj;,
      and support the <xref linkend="makecheck"/> target.</para>

      <para>You also need to include two targets important to &dj;:
      <emphasis>check</emphasis>, to run the tests, and
      <emphasis>site.exp</emphasis>, to set up the Tcl copies of
      configuration-dependent values. This is called the
      <xref linkend="local"/> The <emphasis>check</emphasis> target
      must invoke the <command>runtest</command> program to run the
      tests.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>site.exp</emphasis> target should usually
      set up (among other things) the <emphasis>$tool</emphasis>
      variable for the name of your program. If the
      local <filename>site.exp</filename> file is setup correctly, it
      is possible to execute the tests by merely
      typing <command>runtest</command> on the command line.</para>

      <title>Adding A New Target</title>

      <para>&dj; has some additional requirements for target support, beyond
      the general-purpose provisions of configure. &dj; must actively
      communicate with the target, rather than simply generating or managing
      code for the target architecture.  Therefore, each tool requires an
      initialization module for each target.  For new targets, you must supply
      a few Tcl procedures to adapt &dj; to the target.  This permits
      &dj; itself to remain target independent.</para>

      <para>Usually the best way to write a new initialization module is to
      edit an existing initialization module; some trial and error will be
      required. If necessary, you can use the <option>--debug</option> option to see what
      is really going on.</para>

      <para>When you code an initialization module, be generous in
      printing information controlled by
      the <function>verbose</function> procedure.  In
      cross-development environments, most of the work is in getting
      the communications right. Code for communicating via TCP/IP
      networks or serial lines is available in a &dj; library files
      such as <filename>lib/telnet.exp</filename>.</para>

      <para>If you suspect a communication problem, try running the connection
      interactively from <productname>Expect</productname>.  (There are three
      ways of running <productname>Expect</productname> as an interactive
      interpreter.  You can run <productname>Expect</productname> with no
      arguments, and control it completely interactively; or you can use
      <command>expect -i</command> together with other command-line options and
      arguments; or you can run the command <command>interpreter</command> from
      any <productname>Expect</productname> procedure.  Use
      <command>return</command> to get back to the calling procedure (if any),
      or <command>return -tcl</command> to make the calling procedure itself
      return to its caller; use <command>exit</command> or end-of-file to leave
      Expect altogether.)  Run the program whose name is recorded in
      <symbol>$connectmode</symbol>, with the arguments in
      <symbol>$targetname</symbol>, to establish a connection.  You should at
      least be able to get a prompt from any target that is physically
      connected.</para>

      board file, it's easiest to copy an existing one. It is also
      possible to have your file be based on a
      <emphasis>baseboard</emphasis> file with only one or two
      changes needed. Typically, this can be as simple as just
      changing the linker script. Once the new baseboard file is done,
      add it to the <symbol>boards_DATA</symbol> list in the
      <filename>dejagnu/baseboards/Makefile.am</filename>, and regenerate the
      Makefile.in using automake. Then just rebuild and install &dj;. You
      can test it by:</para>

      <para>There is a crude inheritance scheme going on with board files, so
      you can include one board file into another, The two main procedures used
      to do this are <function>load_generic_config</function> and
      <function>load_base_board_description</function>. The generic config file
      contains other procedures used for a certain class of target. The
      board description file is where the board specific settings go. Commonly
      there are similar target environments with just different
      processors.</para>

      <example>
      <title>Testing a New Board Configuration File</title>

      <screen>
      make check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=<emphasis>newboardfile</emphasis>".
      </screen>
      </example>

      <para>Here's an example of a board config file. There are
      several <emphasis>helper procedures</emphasis> used in this
      example. A helper procedure is one that look for a tool of files
      in commonly installed locations. These are mostly used when
      testing in the build tree, because the executables to be tested
      are in the same tree as the new dejagnu files. The helper
      procedures are the ones in square braces
      <emphasis>[]</emphasis>, which is the Tcl execution characters.</para>

      <title>Writing A Test Case</title>

      <para>The easiest way to prepare a new test case is to base it
      on an existing one for a similar situation.  There are two major
      categories of tests: batch or interactive.  Batch oriented tests
      are usually easier to write.</para>

      <para>The GCC tests are a good example of batch oriented tests.
      All GCC tests consist primarily of a call to a single common
      procedure, since all the tests either have no output, or only
      have a few warning messages when successfully compiled.  Any
      non-warning output is a test failure.  All the C code needed is
      kept in the test directory.  The test driver, written in Tcl,
      need only get a listing of all the C files in the directory, and
      compile them all using a generic procedure. This procedure and a
      few others supporting for these tests are kept in the library
      module <filename>lib/c-torture.exp</filename> in the GCC test
      suite. Most tests of this kind use very few
      <productname>Expect</productname> features, and are coded almost
      purely in Tcl.</para>

      <para>Writing the complete suite of C tests, then, consisted of
      these steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem><para>Copying all the C code into the test directory.
      These tests were based on the C-torture test created by Torbjorn
      Granlund (on behalf of the Free Software Foundation) for GCC
      development.</para></listitem>

      compilation.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Writing the simple test driver: its main task is to
      search the directory (using the Tcl procedure
      <emphasis>glob</emphasis> for filename expansion with wildcards)
      and call a Tcl procedure with each filename.  It also checks for
      a few errors from the testing procedure.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Testing interactive programs is intrinsically more
      complex.  Tests for most interactive programs require some trial
      and error before they are complete.</para>

      <para>However, some interactive programs can be tested in a
      simple fashion reminiscent of batch tests.  For example, prior
      to the creation of &dj;, the GDB distribution already
      included a wide-ranging testing procedure.  This procedure was
      very robust, and had already undergone much more debugging and
      error checking than many recent &dj; test cases.
      Accordingly, the best approach was simply to encapsulate the
      existing GDB tests, for reporting purposes. Thereafter, new GDB
      tests built up a family of Tcl procedures specialized for GDB
      testing.</para>

      debugging output appears in the detailed output recorded in the

      <command>verbose</command> procedure (which in turn uses the
      variable also called <emphasis>verbose</emphasis>) to control
      how much output to generate.  This will make it easier for other
      people running the test to debug it if necessary.  Whenever
      possible, if <emphasis>$verbose</emphasis> is

      output from <emphasis>pass</emphasis>,

      appropriate for the particular test, allow successively higher

       shows precisely the characters received.  Iterating between the
       latest attempt at a new test script and the corresponding

    <sect2 id="adding" xreflabel="Adding a test case to a testsuite">
      <title>Adding a test case to a testsuite</title>

      <para>There are two slightly different ways to add a test
      case. One is to add the test case to an existing directory. The
      other is to create a new directory to hold your test. The
      existing test directories represent several styles of testing,
      all of which are slightly different; examine the directories for
      the tool of interest to see which (if any) is most suitable.</para>

      <para>Adding a GCC test can be very simple: just add the C code
      to any directory beginning with <filename>gcc</filename> and it
      runs on the next: </para>
      <programlisting>runtest --tool gcc</programlisting>

      <para>To add a test to GDB, first add any source code you will
      need to the test directory. Then you can either create a new
      expect file, or add your test to an existing one (any
      file with a <emphasis>.exp</emphasis> suffix).  Creating a new
      .exp file is probably a better idea if the test is significantly
      different from existing tests. Adding it as a separate file also
      makes upgrading easier. If the C code has to be already compiled
      before the test will run, then you'll have to add it to the
      <filename>Makefile.in</filename> file for that test directory,
      then run <command>configure</command> and

    <sect2 id="hints" xreflabel="Hints On Writing A Test Case">
      <title>Hints On Writing A Test Case</title>

      <para>It is safest to write patterns that match all the output
      generated by the tested program; this is called closure.
      If a pattern does not match the entire output, any output that
      remains will be examined by the next <command>expect</command>
      command. In this situation, the precise boundary that determines
      which <command>expect</command> command sees what is very
      sensitive to timing between the Expect task and the task running
      the tested tool.  As a result, the test may sometimes appear to
      work, but is likely to have unpredictable results. (This problem
      is particularly likely for interactive tools, but can also
      affect batch tools---especially for tests that take a long time
      to finish.) The best way to ensure closure is to use the
      <option>-re</option> option for the <command>expect</command>
      command to write the pattern as a full regular expressions; then
      you can match the end of output using a <emphasis>$</emphasis>.
      It is also a good idea to write patterns that match all
      available output by using <emphasis>.*\</emphasis> after the
      text of interest; this will also match any intervening blank
      lines.  Sometimes an alternative is to match end of line using
      <emphasis>\r</emphasis> or <emphasis>\n</emphasis>, but this is
      usually too dependent on terminal settings.</para>

      <para>Always escape punctuation, such as <emphasis>(</emphasis>
      or <emphasis>&quot;</emphasis>, in your patterns; for example, write
      <emphasis>\(</emphasis>.  If you forget to escape punctuation,
      you will usually see an error message like:</para>
      <programlisting>extra characters after close-quote</programlisting>

      <para>If you have trouble understanding why a pattern does not
      match the program output, try using the <option>--debug</option>
      option to <command>runtest</command>, and examine the debug log
      carefully.</para>

      <para>Be careful not to neglect output generated by setup rather
      than by the interesting parts of a test case.  For example,
      while testing GDB, I issue a send <emphasis>set height
      0\n</emphasis> command.  The purpose is simply to make sure GDB
      never calls a paging program.  The <emphasis>set
      height</emphasis> command in GDB does not generate any
      output; but running any command makes GDB issue a new
      <emphasis>(gdb) </emphasis> prompt.  If there were no
      <command>expect</command> command to match this prompt, the
      output <emphasis>(gdb) </emphasis> begins the text seen by the
      next <command>expect</command> command---which might make that
      pattern fail to match.</para>

      <para>To preserve basic sanity, I also recommended that no test
      ever pass if there was any kind of problem in the test case.  To
      take an extreme case, tests that pass even when the tool will
      not spawn are misleading. Ideally, a test in this sort of
      situation should not fail either. Instead, print an error
      message by calling one of the &dj; procedures
      <command>error</command> or <command>warning</command>.</para>

      <title>What Is Unit Testing?</title>

      <para>Most regression testing as done by &dj; is system testing:
      the complete application is tested all at once. Unit testing is
      for testing single files, or small libraries. In this case, each
      file is linked with a test case in C or C++, and each function
      or class and method is tested in series, with the test case
      having to check private data or global variables to see if the
      function or method worked.</para>

      <para>This works particularly well for testing APIs and at level
      where it is easier to debug them, than by needing to trace through
      the entire application. Also if there is a specification for the
      API to be tested, the testcase can also function as a compliance
      test.</para>

    <sect2 id="djh" xreflabel="The dejagnu.h header file">
      <title>The dejagnu.h header file</title>

      <para>&dj; uses a single header
      file, <filename>dejagnu.h</filename> to assist in unit
      testing. As this file also produces its one test state output,
      it can be run stand-alone, which is very useful for testing on
      embedded systems. This header file has a C and C++ API for the
      test states, with simple totals, and standardized
      output. Because the output has been standardized, &dj; can be
      made to work with this test case, without writing almost any
      Tcl. The library module, dejagnu.exp, will look for the output
      messages, and then merge them into &dj;'s.</para>
